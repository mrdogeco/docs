```bash cURL
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_live_your_api_key" \
  "https://api.mrdoge.co/v2/matches?sport=soccer&status=upcoming&status=live&locale=en"

  headers: {
    Authorization: "Bearer sk_live_your_api_key",
  },
});
const payload = await response.json();
console.log(`Found ${payload.count} upcoming matches`);

import requests

headers = {'Authorization': 'Bearer sk_live_your_api_key'}
response = requests.get(
    'https://api.mrdoge.co/v2/matches',
    params={'sport': 'soccer', 'status': ['upcoming', 'live'], 'locale': 'en'},
