## Overview

Mr. Doge uses advanced machine learning to analyze sporting events and identify value betting opportunities. Our AI evaluates team performance, match context, and market odds to generate data-driven recommendations.

<Info>
  **Transparency First**: Every recommendation includes clear reasoning you can review. We show our work so you can make informed decisions.
</Info>

## What the AI Analyzes

Our system evaluates multiple factors for each event:

**Team Performance:**
- Recent form and results
- Home vs away performance splits
- Head-to-head history
- Scoring and defensive patterns

**Match Context (Priority Leagues):**
- Team news and lineup information
- Weather conditions
- Tactical matchups

**Market Analysis:**
- Current odds evaluation
- Market efficiency assessment
- Value opportunity detection

<Note>
  **Priority Competitions**: Major leagues (Premier League, La Liga, Champions League, NBA, etc.) receive enhanced analysis with real-time context and deeper research.
</Note>

## Understanding Confidence Levels

Every recommendation has a confidence rating based on statistical edge:

### High Confidence (Edge > 5%)

- **What it means**: Strong statistical advantage over market odds
- **Expected accuracy**: 60-65% win rate
- **When it happens**: Clear form advantage, market inefficiency, or strong tactical mismatch

### Medium Confidence (Edge 3-5%)

- **What it means**: Moderate statistical advantage
- **Expected accuracy**: 55-60% win rate
- **When it happens**: Slight market inefficiency or minor form advantage

### Low Confidence (Edge < 3%)

- **What it means**: Marginal edge, higher risk
- **Expected accuracy**: 50-55% win rate
- **Note**: We rarely recommend Low confidence bets

<Warning>
  **No Guaranteed Winners**: Even High confidence picks can lose. Confidence reflects statistical edge, not certainty. Proper bankroll management is essential.
</Warning>

## Kelly Criterion & Stake Sizing

The AI calculates optimal stake sizes using the **Kelly Criterion**, a mathematical formula for maximizing long-term growth.

### How It Works

```
Kelly % = (Edge × Odds - 1) / (Odds - 1)
```

**Example:**
- Odds: 2.10
- Edge: 6.8%
- Kelly = 3.2% of bankroll

### Fractional Kelly (Recommended)

We recommend **10% fractional Kelly** for safer bankroll management:

- Full Kelly: 3.2% of bankroll
- 10% Fractional Kelly: **0.32%** of bankroll

**Why Fractional Kelly?**
- Reduces volatility
- More conservative approach
- Protects against estimation errors
- Still captures most of the edge

### Practical Example

**Your Bankroll: $1,000**

**Recommendation:**
- Odds: 2.10
- Edge: 6.8%
- Kelly Fraction: 0.032 (3.2%)

**Stake Calculation:**
- Full Kelly: $1,000 × 0.032 = $32
- 10% Fractional Kelly: $32 × 0.10 = **$3.20**

<Tip>
  **Start Small**: If you're new to value betting, consider using 5% fractional Kelly (half our recommendation) until you're comfortable with variance.
</Tip>

## Reading Recommendations

Every recommendation includes three key sections:

### Rationale

Why the AI picked this bet:

```json
"rationale": [
  "Home team's excellent form (8 wins in last 10)",
  "Away team struggling defensively (10 goals conceded in 3 games)",
  "Strong home advantage (75% win rate at home)"
]
```

**Look for:**
- ✅ Data-backed claims with recent statistics
- ✅ Specific tactical insights
- ✅ Clear logical reasoning

### Risk Factors

Reasons why the pick might not win:

```json
"riskFactors": [
  "Away team has key players returning from injury",
  "Weather forecast shows heavy rain"
]
```

**Use this to:**
- Assess if the risk outweighs the edge
- Decide whether to skip the bet
- Adjust stake size if unsure

### Data Support

Statistical basis for the recommendation:

```json
"dataSupport": [
  "Simulation gives 52% home win probability vs 47.6% implied by odds",
  "Expected goals: Home 1.8, Away 1.1"
]
```

This shows you the math behind the recommendation.

## Market Efficiency Score

The AI calculates a **Market Efficiency Score** (0-100) for each event:

- **90-100**: Extremely efficient, rare value opportunities
- **80-89**: Efficient market, requires deep analysis
- **70-79**: Moderately efficient, value exists
- **Below 70**: Inefficient market, multiple opportunities

**What affects efficiency:**
- League popularity (Premier League more efficient than lower tiers)
- Time until kickoff (closer = more efficient)
- Public attention (high-profile matches = more efficient)

- Single-bet recommendations

**Access:** `GET /v2/ai/betting-recommendations` (2 credits)

### Mr. Doge Picks

**What they are:**
- Curated picks combining multiple recommendations
- Featured selections for maximum value
- Can be single events or parlays
- Pre-calculated combined odds

**Access:** `GET /v2/ai/mrdoge-picks` (10 credits)

<Tip>
  **For Beginners**: Start with individual Betting Recommendations to understand how the AI works. Graduate to Mr. Doge Picks once you're comfortable.
</Tip>

## Limitations & Disclaimers

### What the AI Can't Predict

- **Referee decisions**: Red cards, penalties, VAR calls
- **Individual brilliance**: Wonder goals, goalkeeper errors
- **Motivational factors**: Team morale, manager pressure
- **Random variance**: Bad luck, post hits, own goals

### Past Performance ≠ Future Results

The AI analyzes historical data, but:
- Teams change (injuries, form shifts, new players)
- Tactics evolve
- External factors matter (weather, referee, crowd)
- Variance is inherent in sports

<Warning>
  **No Guarantee of Profit**: Value betting requires discipline, bankroll management, and patience. Short-term losses are normal even with positive expected value. Only bet what you can afford to lose.
</Warning>

## FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How often are recommendations updated?" icon="clock">
    AI analysis runs continuously:
    - New events analyzed as they become available
    - Recommendations refresh when odds change significantly
    - Enhanced analysis runs 24-48 hours before kickoff for priority matches
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why some matches are missing recommendations?" icon="question">
    Possible reasons:
    - Data quality doesn't meet standards
    - Event too far in the future (odds not stable)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I trust High confidence picks?" icon="shield-check">
    High confidence picks have a **statistical edge**, meaning over many bets they should be profitable. However:
    - Any single pick can lose (variance is normal)
    - We estimate 60-65% win rate for High confidence
    - Requires proper bankroll management
    - Long-term discipline is essential
