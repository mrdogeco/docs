    Check the order summary:
    - Package name and credit amount

    - Expiration date
    - CVC security code

      - New balance
      - Transaction ID

    You can start using the API immediately with your new credits.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Auto-Recharge

Auto-Recharge automatically purchases credits when your balance drops below a threshold you set. Never worry about running out of credits or API downtime.

<Info>
  **Set it and forget it!** Once configured, auto-recharge runs in the background and keeps your API running 24/7.
</Info>

### How Auto-Recharge Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="You Set a Threshold">
    Choose when to trigger auto-recharge (e.g., when balance < 1,000 credits)
  </Step>

  <Step title="You Choose a Package">
    Select which credit package to purchase automatically (e.g., GROWTH - 100,000 credits)
  </Step>

  <Step title="We Monitor Your Balance">
    Our system checks your credit balance after each API request
  </Step>

  <Step title="Auto-Purchase Triggers">
    When balance drops below threshold, we automatically:
    - Charge your saved payment method
    - Add credits to your account
    - Send you a confirmation email
  </Step>

  <Step title="You Keep Running">
    Your API continues working without interruption. You'll never see a 402 error!
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Setting Up Auto-Recharge

1. Log in to [mrdoge.co/dashboard](https://mrdoge.co/dashboard)
2. Go to **Credits → Auto-Recharge Settings**
3. Toggle **Enable Auto-Recharge** to ON
4. Configure your settings:
   - **Threshold:** When to trigger (e.g., 1,000 credits)
   - **Package:** Which package to buy (e.g., GROWTH)
   - **Payment Method:** Select saved card
5. Click **Save Settings**

<Check>
  **That's it!** Auto-recharge is now active.
</Check>

### Recommended Thresholds

| Threshold | Best For | Example |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **100 credits** | Very low traffic, cost-sensitive | Hobby projects, testing |
| **1,000 credits** | Low-medium traffic | Small production apps |
| **5,000 credits** | Medium traffic | Growing applications |
| **10,000 credits** | High traffic | Established platforms |
| **50,000 credits** | Very high traffic | Enterprise systems |

<Tip>
  **Recommended:** Set threshold to **2-3 days worth** of typical usage. This prevents frequent charges while ensuring you never run out.
</Tip>
