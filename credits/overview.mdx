## What Are Credits?

Credits are the currency of the Mr. Doge API. Instead of monthly subscriptions or complex tier plans, you purchase credits once and use them as you make API requests. Think of credits like prepaid phone minutes - buy what you need, use when you want.

<Info>
  **1 credit = 1 API request** for most endpoints. No hidden fees, no monthly charges, no commitment.
</Info>

## Why Credits Instead of Subscriptions?

  <Card title="Pay Only for What You Use" icon="hand-holding-dollar">
    Don't waste money on monthly subscriptions when you have seasonal usage. Buy credits when you need them.
  </Card>

  <Card title="No Expiration" icon="infinity">
    Credits never expire. Buy once, use over months or years. Perfect for hobby projects and irregular usage patterns.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Predictable Costs" icon="calculator">
    Know exactly what each API call costs. No surprise bills at the end of the month.

## How Credits Work

<Steps>
  <Step title="Purchase Credits">
    Buy a credit package that fits your needs - from $29.90 to $999.90
  </Step>

  <Step title="Make API Requests">
    Each API call automatically deducts credits based on the endpoint cost (usually 1 credit)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Track Usage">
    Monitor your credit balance in real-time via response headers and the dashboard
  </Step>

  <Step title="Recharge When Needed">
    Buy more credits manually or enable auto-recharge to never run out
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Credit Consumption

### Standard Endpoints (1 Credit)

Most endpoints cost **1 credit** per request:

- `/v2/matches` - Get matches with odds (supports `status=live` for live events)
- `/v2/matches/{matchId}` - Single match details (markets + status)
- `/v2/teams` - Search teams
- `/v2/ai/betting-recommendations` - AI recommendations (filtered)
- And 20+ more standard endpoints

### Free Endpoints (0 Credits)

Some public endpoints are completely free:

- `/v2/health` - API health check
- `/v2/regions` - Available regions/countries
- `/v2/competitions` - List competitions
- `/v2/stats` - System statistics

### Premium Endpoints (2-10 Credits)

Advanced features cost more:

- `/v2/bets/bet-items/{betItemId}/odds-movement` - **2 credits** - Historical odds data
- `/v2/matches/{eventId}/live-odds` - **2 credits** - Current live odds
- `/v2/ai/value-opportunities` - **5 credits** - Best value bets with edge analysis
- `/v2/ai/mrdoge-picks` - **10 credits** - Featured parlay picks with AI analysis

## Monitoring Your Credits

### Response Headers

Every API response includes your credit status:

```bash
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-Credits-Remaining: 19850
X-Credits-Consumed: 1
X-Auto-Recharge: false
```

**Example in code:**
```javascript
const response = await fetch('https://api.mrdoge.co/v2/matches?locale=en', {
  headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer sk_live_...' }
});

console.log('Remaining:', response.headers.get('X-Credits-Remaining')); // 19850
console.log('This request cost:', response.headers.get('X-Credits-Consumed')); // 1
```

<Tip>
  You can also monitor your credit balance and usage analytics in the [dashboard](https://mrdoge.co/dashboard).
</Tip>

## What Happens When Credits Run Out?

When your balance reaches **0 credits**, the API will:

1. **Return HTTP 402** (Payment Required)
2. **Provide error details:**
   ```json
   {
     "statusCode": 402,
     "message": "Insufficient credits",
     "creditsRequired": 1,
     "creditsRemaining": 0,
     "error": "Payment Required"
   }
   ```
3. **Stop processing requests** until credits are added

## Optimizing Credit Usage

Save credits with these best practices:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Cache Responses" icon="database">
    Store frequently-accessed data (regions, competitions) locally instead of fetching repeatedly.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Use Free Endpoints" icon="gift">
    Leverage free endpoints like `/v2/regions` and `/v2/stats` for reference data.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Batch Requests" icon="layer-group">
    Use filters to get multiple events in one request instead of calling events individually.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Smart Polling" icon="clock">
    For live data, poll every 10-20 seconds instead of every second.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Example: Efficient vs. Inefficient

<CodeGroup>
```javascript ❌ Inefficient (100 credits)
// Fetching 100 events individually
for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
  await fetch(`https://api.mrdoge.co/v2/matches/${eventIds[i]}?locale=en`, {
    headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer sk_live_...' }
  }); // 100 requests = 100 credits
}
```

```javascript ✅ Efficient (1 credit)
// Fetch all events in one request with filters
const response = await fetch(
  'https://api.mrdoge.co/v2/matches?competitionId=premier-league&limit=100&locale=en',
  { headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer sk_live_...' } }
); // 1 request = 1 credit!
```

## FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do credits ever expire?" icon="calendar-xmark">
    **No, never.** Credits remain in your account indefinitely until you use them. Buy once, use whenever you want - even years later.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I get a refund if I don't use all my credits?" icon="money-bill-transfer">
    **No.** Credits are like gift cards - non-refundable once purchased. However, since they never expire, you can use them at any time in the future.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if I accidentally bought too many credits?" icon="circle-exclamation">
    Contact support@mrdoge.co within 24 hours if you made a purchase error. We'll review on a case-by-case basis.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I transfer credits to another account?" icon="right-left">
    **No.** Credits are tied to your account and cannot be transferred. For team/organization use, create a shared account.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do unused credits roll over?" icon="rotate">
    There's no concept of "rollover" because credits never expire. Every credit you purchase stays in your account forever.
