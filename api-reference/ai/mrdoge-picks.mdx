## Understanding Parlays

<Warning>
  **Parlay Risk**: All selections in a parlay must win for the bet to win. While parlays offer higher potential returns, they have significantly lower win probability.
</Warning>

### Parlay Win Probability

Example 3-leg parlay with 60% individual win rate:
- Probability all 3 win: 0.60³ = **21.6%**
- Individual bet at same odds would need ~55-58% win rate

We only create parlays when:
1. Each leg has High confidence (>60% expected win rate)
2. Combined edge is still positive after accounting for correlation
3. Events are independent (no overlapping outcomes)

## Credit Cost

<Info>
  **10 credits per request** - Mr. Doge Picks cost more because they include enhanced analysis, correlation checking, and curation beyond simple recommendations.
