## Understanding the Metrics

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Win Rate" icon="percent">
    **Formula**: `Wins / (Wins + Losses)`

    **Note**: Pushes are excluded from win rate calculation since they're neither wins nor losses.

    **Expected Ranges**:
    - High Confidence: 60-65%
    - Medium Confidence: 55-60%
    - Low Confidence: 50-55%
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Parlays vs Singles" icon="chart-line">
    **Mr. Doge Picks** (which include parlays) typically have lower win rates than individual recommendations because all legs must win.

    This is expected and doesn't indicate lower quality - parlays offer higher potential returns but lower win probability.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Sample Size" icon="hashtag">
    Performance becomes more reliable with larger sample sizes:
    - **< 50 bets**: Too small for reliable conclusions
    - **50-200 bets**: Starting to be meaningful
    - **200+ bets**: Statistically significant

    We recommend analyzing at least 30 days (typically 200+ recommendations).
