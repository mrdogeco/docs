## Market Efficiency Score

The AI calculates a **Market Efficiency Score** (0-100) for each event:

- **90-100**: Extremely efficient, rare value opportunities
- **80-89**: Efficient market, requires deep analysis
- **70-79**: Moderately efficient, value exists
- **Below 70**: Inefficient market, multiple opportunities

**What affects efficiency:**
- League popularity (Premier League more efficient than lower tiers)
- Time until kickoff (closer = more efficient)
- Public attention (high-profile matches = more efficient)
