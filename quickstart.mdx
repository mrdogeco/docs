## Get Your First Odds in 5 Minutes

This guide will walk you through creating an account, getting your API key, purchasing credits, and making your first API request.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Your Account">

    2. Enter your email and create a password or sign up with Google
    3. You're in instantly — no email verification required. **Every new account gets 500 free credits** to start testing the API immediately.

    </Check>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Purchase Credits">
    Your 500 free credits are great for testing, but when you're ready for production, purchase more credits from your dashboard.

    <Info>
      **Why Credits?** We use a pay-as-you-go model. Buy credits once, use them whenever you need. No monthly subscriptions or hidden fees.
    </Info>

    **Available Packages:**
    - **STARTER**: 20,000 credits - $29.90
    - **GROWTH**: 100,000 credits - $59.90
    - **BUSINESS**: 500,000 credits - $199.90
    - **ENTERPRISE**: 2,000,000 credits - $599.90

    Most endpoints cost only 1 credit per request, so your free 500 credits = 500 API calls!

  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate Your API Key">
    Create your first API key in the dashboard:

    1. Go to **Dashboard → API Keys**
    2. Click **Create API Key**
    3. Enter a name (e.g., "Production App")
    4. Click **Create**

    <Warning>
      Store your API key securely. It provides access to your credits and data. Never commit it to version control or share it publicly.
    </Warning>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Make Your First Request">
    Let's fetch today's soccer matches with odds and AI recommendations!

    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash cURL
    curl -X GET "https://api.mrdoge.co/v2/matches?sport=soccer&status=upcoming&status=live&locale=en" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_live_your_api_key_here"
    ```

    ```javascript JavaScript/Node.js
    const fetch = require('node-fetch');

    async function getEvents() {
      const response = await fetch(
        'https://api.mrdoge.co/v2/matches?sport=soccer&status=upcoming&status=live&locale=en',
        {
          headers: {
            'Authorization': 'Bearer sk_live_your_api_key_here'
          }
        }
      );

      const data = await response.json();

      // Check credit usage
      console.log('Credits Remaining:', response.headers.get('X-Credits-Remaining'));
      console.log('Credits Consumed:', response.headers.get('X-Credits-Consumed'));

      console.log(`Found ${data.count} upcoming soccer matches`);
      return data;
    }

    getEvents();
    ```

    ```python Python
    import requests

    def get_events():
        url = 'https://api.mrdoge.co/v2/matches'
        headers = {'Authorization': 'Bearer sk_live_your_api_key_here'}
        params = {'sport': 'soccer', 'status': ['upcoming', 'live'], 'locale': 'en'}

        response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, params=params)

        # Check credit usage
        print(f"Credits Remaining: {response.headers.get('X-Credits-Remaining')}")
        print(f"Credits Consumed: {response.headers.get('X-Credits-Consumed')}")

        events = response.json()
        print(f"Found {events.get('count', len(events.get('data', [])))} upcoming soccer matches")
        return events

    get_events()
    ```

    ```php PHP
    <?php
    $apiKey = 'sk_live_your_api_key_here';
    $url = 'https://api.mrdoge.co/v2/matches?sport=soccer&status=upcoming&status=live&locale=en';

    $ch = curl_init();
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, $url);
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, [
        'Authorization: Bearer ' . $apiKey
    ]);

    $response = curl_exec($ch);
    $httpCode = curl_getinfo($ch, CURLINFO_HTTP_CODE);

    // Get credit headers
    $headerSize = curl_getinfo($ch, CURLINFO_HEADER_SIZE);
    $headers = substr($response, 0, $headerSize);

    curl_close($ch);

    $events = json_decode($response, true);
    echo "Found " . count($events['data'] ?? []) . " upcoming soccer matches\n";
    ?>
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

    <Check>
      **Success!** You've made your first API request. The response includes:

      - Markets and betting odds
      - AI recommendations with edge percentage
      - Your remaining credit balance in response headers
    </Check>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Monitor Your Usage">
    Track your API usage and credit consumption in real-time:

## Common First-Time Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="401 Unauthorized Error" icon="lock">
    **Problem**: You're getting a 401 error when making requests.

    **Solutions**:
    - Verify your API key is correct and starts with `sk_live_`
    - Ensure you're using Bearer authentication: `Authorization: Bearer sk_live_...`
    - Check that your API key hasn't been deactivated in the dashboard
    - Make sure you have sufficient credits

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="402 Payment Required Error" icon="credit-card">
    **Problem**: Getting a 402 error even though you purchased credits.

    **Solutions**:
    - Check your credit balance in the dashboard
    - Verify the payment was successful (check your email)
    - Wait 1-2 minutes for credits to reflect (usually instant)
    - Contact support if credits don't appear after 5 minutes

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Empty Results Array" icon="list">
    **Problem**: API returns `[]` with no events.

    **Solutions**:
    - Try removing the `sport` filter to see all sports
    - Check if you're filtering by a future date with no scheduled events
    - Add `status=completed` if you need settled events
    - Some sports may not have events during off-season

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Slow Response Times" icon="clock">
    **Problem**: API requests are taking too long.

    **Solutions**:
    - Use pagination with the `limit` parameter (default: 100)
    - Filter by specific `competitionId` or `regionId` instead of fetching all
    - Cache `/v2/matches` responses (or your prerender output) for static pages
    - Check your internet connection
