## Overview

The Mr. Doge API uses **API keys** with **Bearer token authentication** to secure access to endpoints. Every request must include your API key in the Authorization header, and credits are automatically deducted based on the endpoint you're calling.

<Info>
  No complicated OAuth flows or session management. Just include your API key in
  each request header and you're good to go!
</Info>

## API Key Format

All Mr. Doge API keys follow this format:

```
sk_live_followed_by_64_hexadecimal_characters
```

**Example:**

```
sk_live_a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6q7r8s9t0u1v2w3x4y5z6a7b8c9d0e1f2
```

<Warning>
  **Never commit API keys to version control** or share them publicly. Treat
  them like passwords - they provide full access to your account and credits.
</Warning>

## Making Authenticated Requests

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header with the `Bearer` scheme:

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X GET "https://api.mrdoge.co/v2/matches?locale=en" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_live_your_api_key_here"
```

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch("https://api.mrdoge.co/v2/matches?locale=en", {
  headers: {
    Authorization: "Bearer sk_live_your_api_key_here",
  },
});
```

```python Python
import requests

headers = {'Authorization': 'Bearer sk_live_your_api_key_here'}
response = requests.get('https://api.mrdoge.co/v2/matches?locale=en', headers=headers)
```

```php PHP
<?php
$ch = curl_init('https://api.mrdoge.co/v2/matches?locale=en');
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, [
    'Authorization: Bearer sk_live_your_api_key_here'
]);
$response = curl_exec($ch);
?>
```

</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  Replace `locale=en` with `es` or `pt` to receive translated team and competition names.
</Note>

<Info>
  Every API response includes headers showing your credit balance, consumption, and auto-recharge status. See [Monitoring Your Credits](/credits/overview#monitoring-your-credits) for details on tracking usage.
</Info>

## Creating API Keys

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Your Dashboard">
    Log in to [mrdoge.co](https://mrdoge.co/dashboard) and navigate to **API Keys**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Create New Key">
    Select **Create New API Key** button
  </Step>

  <Step title="Name Your Key">
    Enter a descriptive name to identify where this key will be used:
    - `Production App`
    - `Development Environment`
    - `Mobile App iOS`
    - `Testing Purposes`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save Your Key">
    Store it securely in:
    - Environment variables (`.env` file)
    - Secret management service (AWS Secrets Manager, Vault, etc.)
    - Password manager
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  **Maximum 10 API keys** per account. Delete unused keys to create new ones.
</Warning>

## Managing API Keys

### Viewing Your Keys

In the dashboard, you can see:

- **Key Name** - The label you assigned
- **Key Preview** - Last 12 characters (e.g., `sk_live_...d0e1f2`)
- **Created Date** - When the key was generated
- **Last Used** - Most recent API request timestamp
- **Status** - Active or Inactive

### Deactivating Keys

If a key is compromised or no longer needed:

1. Go to **Dashboard → API Keys**
2. Find the key you want to deactivate
3. Click **Deactivate** (or Delete icon)
4. Confirm the action

<Note>
  Deactivated keys stop working immediately. Any requests using that key will
  return a `401 Unauthorized` error.
</Note>

### Key Rotation Best Practices

For security, rotate your API keys periodically:

1. **Create a new API key** with a descriptive name (e.g., `Production App v2`)
2. **Update your application** to use the new key
3. **Test thoroughly** to ensure everything works
4. **Deactivate the old key** after confirming the new one is working
5. **Monitor usage** in the dashboard to verify the switch

<Tip>
  **Recommended rotation schedule**: Every 90 days for production keys, or
  immediately if you suspect a key has been exposed.
</Tip>

## Credit-Based Authentication

The Mr. Doge API uses a **credit-based pay-as-you-go** model instead of traditional rate limits.

### How It Works

1. **Purchase credits** in packages
2. **Make API requests** - credits are automatically deducted
3. **Monitor usage** via response headers and dashboard
4. **Auto-recharge** (optional) when balance runs low

### Endpoint Costs

Most endpoints cost **1 credit** per request. Some specialized endpoints cost more:

| Endpoint Category                                              | Cost per Request     |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| No-cost endpoints (regions, competitions, health)              | **0 credits** (free) |
| Standard matches endpoint (`/v2/matches`)                      | **1 credit**         |
| Trending matches endpoint (`/v2/matches/trending`)             | **2 credits**        |
| Specific match endpoint (`/v2/matches/{matchId}`)              | **1 credit**         |
| Match settlement (`/v2/bets/events/{eventId}/settle-bet`)      | **1 credit**         |
| Live odds (`/v2/matches/{matchId}/live-odds`)                  | **2 credits**        |
| AI recommendations (`/v2/ai/betting-recommendations`)          | **2 credits**        |
| AI predictions (`/v2/ai/mrdoge-picks`)                         | **3 credits**        |

## Security Best Practices

### Environment Variables

Store API keys in environment variables, never hardcode them:

<CodeGroup>
```javascript .env File
# .env
MRDOGE_API_KEY=sk_live_your_api_key_here
```

```javascript Node.js
require("dotenv").config();

const apiKey = process.env.MRDOGE_API_KEY;

fetch("https://api.mrdoge.co/v2/matches?locale=en", {
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${apiKey}` },
});
```

```python Python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()
api_key = os.getenv('MRDOGE_API_KEY')

headers = {'Authorization': f'Bearer {api_key}'}
```

</CodeGroup>

### Don't Expose Keys in Frontend

<Warning>
  **Never use API keys directly in client-side JavaScript** - they'll be visible
  in browser dev tools and can be stolen.
</Warning>

**Instead:**

- Create a **backend proxy** that makes API calls on behalf of your frontend
- Use **serverless functions** (Vercel, Netlify, AWS Lambda) to keep keys secure
- Implement **user authentication** in your app, then make API calls server-side

**Example Architecture:**

```
Frontend (React/Vue/etc.)
    ↓ HTTP request (no API key)
Backend API (Node.js/Python/PHP)
    ↓ HTTP request (with API key in server)
Mr. Doge API
```

## FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I use the same API key across multiple applications?" icon="question-circle">
    **Yes**, but we recommend creating separate keys for each application/environment:
    - Easier to track usage per application
    - Rotate keys without affecting all apps
    - Deactivate compromised keys in isolation
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if someone steals my API key?" icon="shield-exclamation">
    **Immediately:**
    1. Go to Dashboard → API Keys
    2. Deactivate the compromised key
    3. Create a new key
    4. Update your application

    The stolen key will stop working immediately. Monitor your usage for any suspicious activity.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do API keys expire?" icon="clock">
    **No**, API keys never expire. They remain active until you deactivate them manually.

    However, we recommend rotating keys every 90 days for security best practices.
